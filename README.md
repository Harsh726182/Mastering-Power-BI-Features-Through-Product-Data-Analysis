 Title: Mastering Power BI Features through Product Data Analysis
 
 Objective: To provide students with hands-on experience in using advanced Power BI features to
 analyze and gain insights from product data, enhancing their data analysis and visualization skills.
 
Tasks:
 1. Create a custom column that calculates the profit margin for each product. Use the formula:
 ProfitMargin = (ProductPrice- ProductCost) / ProductPrice. Name this column "ProfitMargin".
 Add aconditional column to classify products as "High Margin", "Medium Margin", or "Low
 Margin" based on their profit margin. Define the thresholds: High Margin (> 0.5), Medium
 Margin (0.2- 0.5), Low Margin (< 0.2).
 2. Use the Q&Afeature to find out "What is the average product cost by product color?" and
 display the results as a bar chart.
 3. Create a decomposition tree to analyze ProductPrice by ProductColor and further by
 ProductStyle. Identify key drivers for high prices.
4. Use the Key Influencer visual to determine which factors (e.g., ProductColor, ProductSize,
 ProductStyle) influence high product prices. Provide a summary of your findings.
 5. Create a new column using the "Column from Example" feature to extract the first letter from
 the product color column (eg: red should be R, etc). Create a table visual to display the total
 product cost by product color. Highlight the costs column using conditional formatting (highest
 costs in dark pink, medium costs in light pink and lowest costs in white)
 6. Set up bookmarks to save different views of your report. Create bookmarks for views by
 ProductStyle, ProductColor, and ProductSize based on your own set conditions or filters.
 7. Create a single row card to display the total number of unique products in the dataset. Create
 a multi-row card to display the total product cost, total product price, and average profit
 margin.
 8. Add a reference line in a line chart to show the average product price over different product
 styles.
9. Identify and remove any duplicate product records in the dataset.
 10. Create a Treemap to show product price for each color and subcategory. Also show the top
